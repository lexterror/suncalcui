# suncalcui

A simple user interface for "suncalc" written in Javascript/HTML/CSS.

Runs on any web-browser with Javascript enabled.

This program allows you to view the sunrise, sunset, solarnoon, moonrise, moonset, and moonphase in a browser.

I only added 3 cities and the options to select any other location from around the world at any time with longitude and latitude.

You can add as many cities as you like.
